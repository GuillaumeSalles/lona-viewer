# lona-viewer

Display your [Lona](https://github.com/airbnb/Lona) components directly on the web!

[Demo](https://guillaumesalles.github.io/lona-viewer/)

_Just a quick and dirty proof of concept for now! It only handle the material design sample. Lot of features are missing..._

## Todo

* Finish layer props

### TODO for layer properties

* Display components parameters
* Display color as a colored square
* image as square thumbnail + clickable icon
* text as textbox
